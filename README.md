# LEAP Program — Sprint 9 Lab Exercises

This repository contains the hands-on lab exercises accompanying **Sprint 9: UI Development
with Angular**, week 9 of the LEAP graduate programme.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22.22.3+ or 24.15.0+ (the Angular CLI will refuse to run on older Node 22.x patch
  versions) and npm
- Angular CLI, pinned to **Angular 21** (`npm install -g @angular/cli@21`, or use
  `npx @angular/cli@21`) — paired with **TypeScript 5.9**, not the newest Angular/TS release
- TypeScript from Sprint 8 (interfaces, generics, decorators) — assumed, not re-taught
- No prior HTML, CSS, or browser JavaScript experience assumed — Day 1 builds this from
  zero, before Angular is introduced at all
- A working checkout of Sprint 6/7's mission service (Spring Boot) and Sprint 8's
  `sprint8-auth-service` (NestJS) — Modules 4, 5, 11, and 12 make real calls against both
- Docker, and the same `sprint6-postgres` container used in Sprint 8, Module 15
- GitHub Copilot Chat (continuing as a learning aid)

## Coming from Sprint 8

By the end of Sprint 8 the mission had a complete backend: Postgres (Sprint 3) behind a
Spring Boot service (Sprint 5/6/7) authenticated by a real NestJS auth service (Sprint 8),
proven to work end to end with `curl`. Sprint 9 builds the piece that turns that into
something a person can actually use: an Angular front end. See `shared/mission-brief.md`.

Sprint 8 taught JavaScript and TypeScript entirely in a Node.js context — no HTML, no CSS,
no DOM, no browser. Day 1 of this sprint (Modules 1-4) closes that gap with real,
hands-on HTML/CSS/browser-JS work before Angular is introduced in Module 6.

## Structure

Each module has its own folder under `demos/`, `labs/`, and `solutions/`, following the same
pattern as every previous sprint.

- `demos/<module>/` — instructor-led demo assets and guides
- `labs/<module>/` — your starter files and the task README for that module
- `solutions/<module>/` — reference solutions (try the lab first!)
- `solutions/mission-ui/` — from Module 7 onward, the one canonical Angular project that
  `solutions/07-.../` through `solutions/17-.../` build up incrementally, module by module.
  Your own `mission-ui` (scaffolded per Module 7) is where you keep building — this is the
  instructor-facing answer key, not something you clone directly.

## Getting started

1. Clone this repository.
2. `cd` into a module's `labs/<module>/` folder and check that module's README for setup.
3. Work through the modules in order, starting with `labs/01-.../README.md`.
